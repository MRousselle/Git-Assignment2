				The Carnival of Time is the day at the very end of the Termina calendar where we celebrate the year gone by and commit it to our bygone memories.  The Clock Tower opens and we cheer to the sound of the twelve chimes of midnight.  There will be ceremonies to celebrate the Moon as well as offerings from all of Termina's native races.
