					The Oregon Summit, featuring Google for Education, is an annual, educator-led conference. We have had five years of fun and learning so far. Each year had its own theme: Legos in 2010, cookies in 2011, robots in 2012, Mt. Hood in 2013, bikes in 2014. This year we're celebrating and having fun with paper airplanes. We have two sites this year and invite you to join us at Hillsboro High School or McNary High School on October 9.

				<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
				<h3>What's the cost to attend Oregon's Google Summit?</h3>
				<p>The summit is free to attend. Lunch is included. Beginning in 2015, we will solicit donations to cover meals and a facility thank you.</p>
				<h3>What do I need to bring with me to the Google Summit?</h3>
				<p>It's a great idea to bring a laptop. iPads don't have a browser maximized for the use of Google Apps for Education. Bring your best questions and your thinking cap. We hope to work your brain extra hard and give you great ideas.</p>
				<h3>What if I've never used Google Apps for Education before?</h3>
				<p>There is no need for you to have experience with Google Apps for Education prior to the day of the Summit. We do ask that you have access to a Google account. This can be the account your school district has set up for you or a personal Google account. To obtain your own Google account <span class="inline">please visit this page.</span></p>
				<h3>Where can I get more information about attending via Hangout?</h3>
				<p>Please visit our <span class="inline">page for virtual participants.</span></p>
				<h3>At the Google Summit, how can I make sure I'm online?</h3>
				<p>Connect to the guest network. If you have trouble after a few minutes, please see someone in a Summit t-shirt. We're thankful to our gracious hosts each year, who beef up their wireless network capacity for our event.</p>
				<p>Please let us know if you have any questions: <span class="inline">support@orvsd.org</span></span></p>
